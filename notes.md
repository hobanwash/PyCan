Yes, GitHub provides **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), and you can define workflows using `.yaml` files to automate your processes like testing, building, and deploying your application.

You can configure a **GitHub Actions workflow** by creating a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository and adding a `.yaml` file (usually named something like `ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`, or `main.yml`), where you define the steps that need to be executed whenever certain events (like pushing code or opening a pull request) occur.

### Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Here's how you can set up a basic CI pipeline for your Flask app inside Docker:

### 1. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File

In the root of your repository, create the following directory structure:

```
.github/
  workflows/
    ci.yml
```

Then, in the `ci.yml` file, you can define your CI/CD pipeline. Here's an example that installs dependencies, builds the Docker container, and runs tests:

### Example `ci.yml` for Flask Docker App

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# This workflow will run on pushes and pull requests to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # Define a job named "build"
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The operating system to run the workflow on

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  # This action checks out your repository

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'  # Define the Python version to use

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies from requirements.txt

    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t flask-app .  # Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        docker run flask-app pytest  # Run your tests (if you have any)

    - name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub (optional)
      run: |
        docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
        docker tag flask-app:latest your_dockerhub_username/flask-app:latest
        docker push your_dockerhub_username/flask-app:latest
      env:
        DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Deploy (optional)
      run: |
        # Add your deployment steps here (e.g., to AWS, Heroku, or a server)
        echo "Deploying the app"
```

### Explanation of the Steps:

1. **Trigger**:
   - The `on` block tells GitHub Actions when to run the workflow. In this case, it runs when changes are pushed or pull requests are created against the `main` branch.

2. **Job (build)**:
   - **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`**: This specifies that the job will run on the latest Ubuntu runner.
   
   - **`actions/checkout@v2`**: This action checks out your repository's code so it can be used in the workflow.
   
   - **Setting up Python**: We use `actions/setup-python@v2` to set up a specific version of Python (3.9 in this case). This is necessary if you need Python dependencies to run tests.
   
   - **Installing dependencies**: It installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if you have any). You can also install `Flask`, `pandas`, or any other dependencies here.
   
   - **Building Docker Image**: It builds the Docker image from the `Dockerfile` in your repo and tags it `flask-app`.
   
   - **Running tests**: This runs your tests using `pytest`. If you have other tests or want to run other types of checks, you can modify this step accordingly.
   
   - **Pushing Docker Image to Docker Hub** (optional): If you want to push the Docker image to Docker Hub (or another container registry), this step logs into Docker Hub using secrets for your username and password, then pushes the image.
   
   - **Deployment** (optional): If you have any deployment steps, such as pushing the app to a server, AWS, Heroku, etc., you can add them here.

### 2. Create `requirements.txt`

If you don’t already have a `requirements.txt`, it’s a good idea to include one so that GitHub Actions can install the Python dependencies. To create one, run the following command in your local environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will include `Flask`, `pandas`, and any other Python dependencies you have.

### 3. Setting Secrets

In the above workflow, you saw the use of `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` as secrets for logging into Docker Hub. To set these secrets in GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, select **Secrets**.
4. Click on the **New repository secret** button.
5. Add the `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets.

### 4. Push to GitHub

Once your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is created and added to your repo, commit and push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor the Workflow

After pushing the code, you can monitor the workflow's progress:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
2. You’ll see the running workflows. Click on one to see the detailed log output and any errors that occur during the process.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Tests**: Add more complex testing to verify the integrity of your code (e.g., unit tests or integration tests).
- **Deploy**: Set up a deployment pipeline that can push the Docker container to cloud providers or any server after a successful build.

### Conclusion

Now, with GitHub Actions configured, you have a simple CI/CD pipeline to automatically build your Docker image, run tests, and even deploy your Flask app. You can further extend the workflow to match your specific use case, such as adding deployment steps or more complex testing.
